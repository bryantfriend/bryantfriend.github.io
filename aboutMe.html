<!-- To get my pictures to align the way I wanted them and give my page a unique look I decided to create a table. The top row is my paragraph and a picture followed
by another row in which the picture goes first followed by a picture -->

                       I started swimming at a very early age. When I was just a toddler my mom would blow in my face to get me to take a breath, then dunk me in the water. After crying a few times 
                    I learned how to hold my breath under water. As I grew up I was swimming whenever I could. One time it was raining and I begged my dad to let me go swimming. When we got to the pool
                    it was freezing but I was just so happy to be there swimming. Of course we were only able to swim for about 10 minutes and when I got out my lips where bluish. I was really, cold. I 
                    kept swimming and when I got to High School I even joined the swim team. Though I love swimming I've never been really fast. I went to every practice and was probably in the best shape
                    of my life when I was on the swim team. Sadly I never won a race. The closest I came was 2nd place in a race of 3 swimmers. I think that in swimming one of the most important things
                    is not so much how much strength or stamina you have but rather your form. Some swimmers have naturally good form and thus it's easier for them to torpedo themselves through the pool
                    other people like me try to use every bit of strength to splash across the pool.

                    Lately, I have not been able to enjoy my hobby as much as I would like. So, instead for the last 20 or so years I have started enjoying watching swimming on TV. I've really enjoyed
                    watching the olympic games and even some world championships. The rivalries are pretty fun, though sometimes the women can get pretty nasty with each other. My favorite swimmer is Micheal
                    Phelps. It has been such a fun time watching him swim through the years and cheering him on from my living room. Watching him take home the gold time and time again has been awesome.
