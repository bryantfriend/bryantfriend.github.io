            Swimming has long been an activity humans have been doing since there was water. There are many reasons why people swim. It could be recreational to have fun with friends or even for work.
            Some people dive for pearls or swim to find clams or other food. Through this site you will be able to find out all sorts of information about one of my favorite hobbies: swimming. To begin
