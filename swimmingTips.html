<!-- Substantive description of page: At the top of this page is my basic menu. This page is about swimming tips that I offer the reader. Eventually,
I will turn it into a blog with the latest tips on top. For now though it just contains 1 tip. I decided to use Heading 2 for the title of each tip and
heading 3 for the actual tip itself. I used a numbered list with text, pictures and a video to help the user understand my tip.-->

        <h2>How to kick your feet</h2>
        <p><h3>A lot of swimmers, especially those starting out tend to focus on their arms and neglect what they are supposed to be doing with their feet. This tip focuses
            on how to learn to kick your feet during the freestyle stroke.

<!-- The meat and potatoes of my tip will be done using a normal list. I will use text, pictures and video when appropriate to create the tip -->    
    
        <ol>
            <li>
            Find a good kickboard that you can use. This will allow you to focus on just your kicking technique.
